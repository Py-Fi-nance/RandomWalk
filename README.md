# RandomWalk

This project visualizes random walk simulations in 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces, demonstrating the paths followed by the random walks in various dimensions.

## 1D Random Walk
In this simulation, an entity starts from position 0 and makes steps to the left or right. This is represented by a line graph where the x-axis denotes the steps taken, and the y-axis denotes the position. 

#### Visualization
The visualization of the 1D random walk can be viewed by running the corresponding sections of the code, which will generate a line graph representing the walk.

## 2D Random Walk
In this simulation, an entity starts from position (0,0) and can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. 

#### Visualization
Running the corresponding sections of the code will yield a plot representing the 2D random walk. Each point in the plot represents the entity's position after each step.

## 3D Random Walk
This simulation is an extension of the 2D random walk, with an entity starting from position (0,0,0) and having the possibility to move in six different directions: forward, backward, left, right, up, or down.

#### Visualization
Running the 3D random walk section of the code will generate a 3D plot visualizing the path taken by the entity in three dimensions.

## Dependencies
- matplotlib
- random

## Usage
To run the simulations, execute the provided Python scripts. Each section in the script corresponds to a different dimension of random walk, and you can visualize them by running the respective sections.
